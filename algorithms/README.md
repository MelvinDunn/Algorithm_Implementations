## Algorithm Implementations

Reading things doesn't really seem to help to learn. I actually need to code this or do it by hand to actually learn it. This is probably why I enjoy doing what I do.

This is a repo for algorithm implementations. Whatever I felt like learning (usually machine learning or natural language, but not limited to), I needed to code -- so I dropped it here.

This uses numpy library in python heavily because no one should ever iterate through a matrix.

You might see that some functions or methods have been repeated across scripts. Again, the point of this is not to make "beautiful code" -- but to learn. Everything is created in one file for ease of learning.
